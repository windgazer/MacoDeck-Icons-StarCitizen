HI THERE!

Thank you for downloading my icon pack, I hope you'll have a lot of fun with it.

Depending on which version of profile you want, you can either doubleclick the "Star Citizen R21 Switches" or the "Star Citizen R21 Buttons"
If you like to have only buttons than you should take the latter.

Emotes are not in this pack, because they dont have a keybinding, I did add a Emote Folder icon, if you want to use this, just copy (ctrl + c) in the streamdeck software and paste it onto a empty area.
You can than change the icon by clicking on it, on the left below you'll see the icon with in the right top of that icon a arrow, click that and click "Set from File" and look for the Emote Folder Icon.

If you need help or have feedback, you can take a look at https://trello.com/b/RqtD4adp/

See you in the verse!



P.S
You can share the icons to others, they are free to use, but it's always nice to link towards the author if you do!
